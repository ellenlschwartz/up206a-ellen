LA Times Op-Ed: ["You shouldnâ€™t need a car to get tested for COVID-19"](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-07/op-ed-drive-through-walk-up-covid-19-coronavirus-testing-sites) by Evelyn Blumenberg and Madeline Brozen 

The authors looked at the 105 COVID-19 testing site locations in LA County, only 42 of which offered walk-up testing, rather than drive-in only. They found that only 9% of the County's population lived within a mile of a walk-up testing site, and that East LA in particular lacked access to testing for carless residents. Then, they looked at how many people would have convenient access to testing if all 105 sites were made walk-up, and it was still just 19%, so they considered how making all public libraries into testing sites would increase the number of people within a mile of testing to 52%. Since public libraries are fairly equitably distributed and have public parking lots, they could be ideal as walk-up testing sites.

I found this article to be a great example of using spatial data - where residents lived, test site locations, and library locations - to draw our attention to two important social problems: (1) programs are often designed in a way that ignores the needs of vulnerable populations, exacerbating inequality, and (2) society assumes everyone has a car. The City of Mountain View also offered drive-in testing initially, and I remember reading a comment on an online newspaper article that someone who had tried to bike up was turned away and made to feel like a second-class citizen. So, I thought this LA Times Op-Ed was powerful for using data to take such concerns beyond the anecdotal level, reveal the extent of the problem, and show how certain neighborhoods were particularly affected. I appreciated how it invited readers to think creatively about how our public spaces such as library parking lots might serve the public in a pandemic, and how it implied that everyone should be able to access their needs via healthy and sustainable modes of transportation. The article was also interesting to me because it relied on spatial data but used this information to create statistics, rather than maps.
